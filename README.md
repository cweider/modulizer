# Modulizer #

## What Is It? ##
This is a tool that will produce a self-contained, environment neutral (read: browser friendly) script from specified files built to the emerging [CommonJS module standard](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1).

## Use ##
The command line tools accepts the following arguments:

 * `--library-path`: Any imported files contained within one of the specified library-paths, will be imported with the appropriate library style path (no leading slash).
 * `--root-path`: Path that all non-library imports will be relative to. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
 * `--import-libraries`: Import all files found in any the libraries specified.
 * `--import-root`: Import all files contained within the specified root path.
 * `--import-dependencies`: Evaluates the required file and includes all files that are required for that evaluation.
 * `--import`: Import the modules at the paths following.
 * `--exclude`: Do not import the modules in the newline separated list specified.
 * `--global-key-path`: The global accessor for the module system, useful when namespacing. This is also the path at which the kernel is installed if specified. Defaults to `require`. 
 * `--include-kernel`: This prepends the output with a basic implementation of a CommonJS module loader.
 * `--report`: This writes a newline separated report of the included modules that can be used in combination with `--exclude`.
